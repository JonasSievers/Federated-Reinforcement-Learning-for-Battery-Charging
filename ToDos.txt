Implement Baselines: No battey, Rule based battery scheduling (Compare with literature, resell price 0.7?)
Optimize environment: Battery model

Implement tracking with Wandb -> Done
Implement custom agent networks -> Done
integrate emissions

Agents: Test different Agents
Model based RL: Include Battery model
Include predictions: PV, Load, Prices
? Implement upper limit: MILP
